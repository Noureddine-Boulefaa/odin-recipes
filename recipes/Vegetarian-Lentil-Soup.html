            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add chopped onion, diced carrots, and diced celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes until vegetables are softened.</li>

            <li>Bring the soup to a boil.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <h3>Simmer the Soup:</h3>

            <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer gently for 25-30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.</li>
            <li>Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Finish and Serve:</h3>

            <li>Remove and discard the bay leaf.</li>
            <li>Season the soup generously with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>If desired, use an immersion blender to partially blend a small portion of the soup for a slightly creamier texture, or leave it chunky.</li>
            <li>Ladle the hot soup into bowls and garnish with fresh chopped parsley, if using.</li>
        </ul>
