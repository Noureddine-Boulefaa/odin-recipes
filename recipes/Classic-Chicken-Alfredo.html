            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Season the cut chicken pieces with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add chicken to the hot skillet and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it's golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cook the Fettuccine:</h3>

            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>Add the fettuccine pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente (firm to the bite).</li>
            <li>Before draining, reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and set aside.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Make the Alfredo Sauce:</h3>

            <li>In the same skillet (or a clean saucepan), melt the butter over medium heat.</li>

            <li>Season the sauce with salt and black pepper to taste. If the sauce is too thick, add a tablespoon or two of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        </ul>
